A prettier way to get your fuel.\r\n\r\n#Stats\r\n\r\nThis is a modernization of DaMichel's DMTanks pack of Spherical Tanks developed in KSP 0.25. The tank configurations have been brought up to KSP 1.0.5+ balance standards, and allow fuel switching with [Firespitter](http://snjo.github.io/#firespitter), [Real Fuels](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58236-*), and [Modular Fuel Tanks](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/58235-*) (not included). These tanks can give some interesting aesthetics to your fuel stations and interplanetary ships and bases, and are great for a different look.\r\n\r\n#License and Permission\r\n\r\nOriginally created by DaMichel.\r\n\r\nUpdated and maintained by [permission from the original author](http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/55842-partswip-damichels-partsfuselage-r2-2222015/&page=4#comment-2568712).\r\n\r\nLicensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0 (Attribution, Share Alike)\r\n",
